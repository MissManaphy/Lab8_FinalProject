Trying to implement collision detection with objects in city

Idea: Use the SAT (Separating Axis Theorem)
SAT states that that two shapes are not intersecting if and only if there exists at 
least one axis where the orthogonal projections of the shapes on this axis do not intersect.
Im taking orthogonal projections to mean the mina dn max points of a shape on a certian
axis bc i just don't have the time to do anythign fancy

how to implement? Have to get max and min points for x, y, and z, axis for all objects
do it for each shape? have another array in code for axis min+maxes
can we be sure that they change when the shapes are transformed? 
- maybe bound it to an analysis of the points individually rather than a number
- it does mean that there is a set of 6 points for each individual object to keep 
track of , but at least it's not all vertexes 
- problem, the fractal has a huge bounding box and wouldn't allow the camera anywhere 
near it in that case (have to use the vertexes and surfaces?)
